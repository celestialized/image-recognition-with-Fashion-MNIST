# J 
Iverson and HUi created it in the 90's - also by Iverson is APL. There is also FL and FP functional languahges. We studied F# in school... APL had a special character problem, so J watered down and uses the ASCII char set. The dot and colons used as inflections to form short words like *digraph*. Trigraphs are short 2 and 3 character sequences that may be viewed as one symbol or single character. I am naturally using an augmented approach to classifying my notes in this directory this way with numeric prefixing, who cares the block or sector grouping indexing for this purpose it is to quickly reference human synapses- mine specifically. If it works for anyone else, great. EBCDIC is 8 bit char encoding (byte) made for two zone number punches in a note card in the 60's, likewise designed to direct traffic on paper- mine is in a project directory and when theres a lot of information, serves a little better to iron out clutter.
