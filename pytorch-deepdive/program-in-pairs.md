# From J to P
That's the great mathematical versatility layer. Now upload laytec into my brain and we are good. Used in extreme programming with Agile and short iterative releases. Program in pairs. Hmmm Beavis, wanna go cowtipping? Strategic direction. One driving the ship, the other navigating. I need to observe a little before that happens. I can tip a cow though, for sure. Results? Fewer Defects. 15%. Who said? 95% happier with a partner. Confidence in pairs 96%. Take that to the bank. Don't crash your rover with that math, get it verified with the appropriate engineer on your team:)

## Programming in pairs- promiscuously
* Develop monitoring mechanisms for their own learning activities
* different experiences come to the table
* access different information relevant to the task
* the relationship is different

Choose the right method. Radix sort vs bubble. does it really matter if brute forcing with Rust? Check the big Oh. There are both empirical studies and meta-analyses of pair programming.

# Catch Design Errors Quicker
* Question established practices

## Problems
* novice-novice pairing with insufficient mentoring.
* Both parties already are knowledgeable may reduce productivity
## Acceptable Options are not always optimal
expert-expert you think its the highest yield- what about insights? Out of the box thinking? Unlikely to question established practices.
expert-novice can push the package. Expert "quill" question the practices when trying to explain them to the novice. Intimidated novice may not act on the gut action for fear of the repercussion. Some experts may not have the patience to mentor and provide constructive novice participation.
