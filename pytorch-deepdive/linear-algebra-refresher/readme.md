# Put it back into the fronto-parietal cortex
Instead of $10 dollar words lets just refresh the $10 dollar concepts behind reduction operations with linear algebra and how to apply this to code. Training a network with a data-set uses a few basic elemental operations we may have gone through in linear algebra and left in the closet to grow dust for a while. Luckily some of us keep our notes- or have malloc'ed more room in their eeprom:)
