Boy I do like the power and speed of libuv with v8 and its threaded model. If we go this route with tensors we need to define use cases that warrant the shift in language, but its entirely possible either way to embedd this in a ROV, especially the Pi 4 and added RAM. This series uses bgg16 preprocessing.
